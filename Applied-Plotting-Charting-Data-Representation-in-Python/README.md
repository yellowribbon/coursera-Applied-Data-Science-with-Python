Week 4 Reference
- A spurious correlation is a correlation that happens from chance alone, and these correlations are one of the reasons scientists use statistics with confidence levels (p-values or confidence intervals) and/or limit their searching to theoretically grounded effects (e.g. pre-registration of hypotheses).

    The spurious correlations website lists a number of correlations which exist but seem unlikely to be causally related to one another. Do you see any in this list which you think are not spurious, and may have a causal relationship? Discuss in the forums, and provide links as appropriate.
